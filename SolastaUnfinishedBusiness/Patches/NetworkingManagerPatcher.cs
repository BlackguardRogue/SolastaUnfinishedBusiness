    // Undoing an unlearned invocation during a level-up never applied in multiplayer (issue 9's second part). The game's
    // NetworkingManager.UndoUnlearnInvocation sends UndoUnlearnInvocationRPC with 4 values (tick, hero, tag, definition
    // name), but the handler takes 5: it also has an Int32 featureType, which it doesn't use. Photon rejects the call on every
    // computer, the sender included ("UndoUnlearnInvocationRPC ... has wrong parameters", 30 times in the logs of the
    // 2026-11-01 to 11-04 sessions), so the hero kept the unlearned invocation. The mod's custom invocation panel calls
    // this for each custom invocation it resets. Sends the same message with the fifth value; the handler then runs the
    // game's own undo on every computer at the same tick, as the other level-up commands do.
