// Long rests at campfires (FunctorStartLongRest, the campfire gadget's functor). User directions, 2026-11-01 and
// 2026-11-02:
// 1. In multiplayer any player can start the long rest at a campfire, not only the host. The game refuses clients
//    (GameRestingManager.CanExecuteLocationRest with player privileges, "only the host can rest"); this follows the
//    setting that already lets every player start rests from the rest screen (MultiplayerAllowPlayersToStartRests).
// 2. When the party is out of the long rest range, an ordinary campfire's long rest gathers it at the campfire first
//    (setting GatherPartyForCampfireRest): the whole party, dead, dying and unconscious characters and guests
//    included, fast travels to the campfire's point (CampfireFastTravelContext; "do not exclude the
//    dead/dying/downed/unconscious characters", "ensure that the fast travel only occurs if there is someone outside
//    of the long rest radius"). Out of range means the game's rule fails (two living members more than 10 cells
//    apart) or anybody, downed included, is more than 10 cells from the campfire's user
//    (CampfireFastTravelContext.NeedsTravel); otherwise the rest runs as without the mod. There is no walk: if the
//    game can't fast travel, the travel fails or enemies interrupt it, nobody rests and the player is told. A party
//    too spread out for the game's rule can still use the campfire, since the gather brings it together; the approval
//    says the party gathers.
// 3. A campfire set to rest at once starts its rest without the multiplayer approval or a gather, as in the game (it
//    asked for an approval in 9b341d45).
//
// How the game runs a campfire: the functor runs on every computer (gadget functors are part of the lockstep), but
// only the computer whose player controls the character that used the campfire opens the rest screen
// (FunctorStartLongRest.IsRestInitiatorControlledByPlayer). An ordinary campfire checks the rest rules first, then
// opens the rest screen with food consumed, and its Start Long Rest button (RestModal.OnStartLongRestCb) starts the
// rest. A campfire set to rest at once (the functor's bool parameter) skips the checks, opens the screen without food
// and presses Start itself. Rests on the world map are the travel's own (GameTravelScheduler), not this functor.
//
// The gather, on the computer that pressed Start (after the approval, in multiplayer): the rest screen closes, as it
// pauses game time while open (RestModal.OnBeginShow calls GameTime.Pause, OnEndHide resumes it; in-game test,
// 2026-11-02); the party fast travels; once the game confirms the party arrived and the rest checks pass again, the
// rest screen opens again with the game's Start pressed, as the game does for a campfire that rests at once. A fight,
// a cutscene or another rest screen opening ends the gather without a rest.
//
// A long rest that has to wait first (the party already rested that day) gathers before the wait (user direction,
// 2026-11-02: "the party is auto gathered before the time skip"). The game checks the once-a-day rule before the
// distance (GameRestingManager.CanExecuteLocationRest), so a campfire offers its wait ("Waiting to Perform a Long
// Rest", FunctorStartLongRest.DoWaitLongRest) even for a spread-out party, and the long rest after the wait
// (StartDeferredLongRestAsync) then refused it as spread out, 16 hours later. Both waits, that one and the rest
// screen's combined wait and long rest (LongRestWaitContext), now gather the party at the campfire first, then wait;
// in multiplayer the gather, the wait and the rest are approved together.
