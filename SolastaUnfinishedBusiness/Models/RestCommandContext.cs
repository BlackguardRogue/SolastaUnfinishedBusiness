// After-rest buttons (Memorize Spell, Spell Mastery, Signature Spells and the mod's custom rest powers) run as functors
// on the computer of the player who clicks them only: the game's AfterRestActionItem calls IFunctorService locally,
// and only the functor itself can tell the other computers. The game's own functors do that (FunctorUsePower sends
// its power through ICommandService, the spell preparation screen sends PrepareSpells), the mod's didn't: they added
// and removed conditions and changed prepared spells directly, so only the clicker's game had them. A condition added
// that way also takes an object ID on one computer only, which is how desync issue 04 was found (a
// ConditionMemorizeSpell on one client, 2026-11-08).
//
// The changes those functors make to the hero now go through this command: it rides on the game's own
// AssignClassLevelRPC in place of a class name (like the level down and the end-infusion commands), so every computer
// runs it at the same tick. The functor on the clicker sends it, waits until its own copy has run, and only then
// carries on (opening the preparation screen, for example). Single player runs the change at once.
