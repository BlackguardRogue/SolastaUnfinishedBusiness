// "[AiMove]" lines (user, 2026-11-09): what each AI-controlled character did with cells in a multiplayer battle, so two
// players' logs can be compared line by line to find where their games split. The host's AI sends its decision to
// everyone, but some details are worked out on each computer, such as where MovePathTowardsTarget stops (it reads that
// computer's own visibility service and the light); a Brood of Blood ended in different cells on two computers in desync
// issue 04 with nothing in the logs to say why.
// - every action an AI activity runs that has target cells (moves, teleports, cell-targeted spells), from
//   ActivityBase.ExecuteAndWait: round, actor, activity, action, from where, to which cells;
// - every stopping cell MovePathTowardsTarget works out, with whether it avoided light and the actor's lighting now.
// Logging only: nothing here changes the game. Multiplayer only, behind Logging > "AI moves" (on by default, like the
// perception lines), and at most MaxLinesPerBattle lines per battle (user, 2026-11-09: the cap is per battle).
