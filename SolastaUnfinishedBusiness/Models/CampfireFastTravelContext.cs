// Fast travel for the campfire gather (user directions, 2026-11-02: "ensure that there is no fast travel point within
// 5 cells of the campfire before creating one. Then, if necessary, create one"; "have all players be moved to the fast
// travel point"; then "for the campfire gather, we always require to fast travel, even if the character is nearby" and
// "do not exclude the dead/dying/downed/unconscious characters"; then "ensure that the fast travel only occurs if
// there is someone outside of the long rest radius"). CampfireRestContext runs it before an ordinary campfire long
// rest when the party is out of range (NeedsTravel): the whole party fast travels to the campfire's point, with no
// walk.
//
// The destination is a map waypoint, as the game's fast travel only goes to one:
// - a fast travel waypoint already within ExistingWaypointRadius cells of the campfire is used as it is;
// - otherwise, when the party is out of range, a temporary waypoint is added next to the campfire's user with the
//   game's own GameLocation.AddWaypoint
//   (the game builds its waypoints from the map's WorldNodes when a location loads; none of them is saved, so a
//   temporary one can't reach a save). It is removed once the fast travel to it ends, a long rest starts, another
//   campfire is used, or the location unloads.
// The destination is set where the campfire's functor runs, which is on every computer in the lockstep: in
// multiplayer every computer must have the waypoint, as the game's fast travel looks it up by position on each one.
//
// The travel is the game's own networked fast travel, unchanged (ICommandService.RequestFastTravel, a lockstep
// command; then the map's MapWaypointItem.PrepareFastTravel and GameLocationMapManager.FastTravel, all on every
// computer): every computer shows the map with the leader (the first party member) going along the route, with the
// game's checks for traps and watching enemies, then the whole party is placed in formation at the point. The game
// leaves nobody out: dead, dying and unconscious characters and guests are placed too (SetupPartyOnDestination copies
// the party and guests without any condition check). A leader already on the point travels a route of no steps (the
// game's own samePosition case). A dead, dying or unconscious leader stops the gather before it travels, with a
// message naming them and their state (DescribeDownedLeader).
